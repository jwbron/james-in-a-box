Lint check: Ensure Claude/Anthropic is not used in host-services.

Host services MUST NOT call Claude or the Anthropic API directly because:
1. Security: Host services have access to credentials that should not be exposed to LLMs
2. Architecture: The container boundary provides security isolation
3. Prompt injection: Direct API calls from host could allow prompt injection to escalate to host access

CORRECT pattern for host-services:
    - Use jib_exec to delegate to a container-side processor
    - The processor (in jib-container/jib-tasks/) can import and use claude/anthropic

INCORRECT patterns:
    - Importing 'from claude import ...' in host-services files
    - Importing 'import anthropic' or 'from anthropic import ...'
    - Adding 'anthropic' as a dependency in host-services/pyproject.toml

This script is intended to be run as a CI check or pre-commit hook.

See: jib-container/.claude/rules/host-container-boundary.md

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-claude-imports.py

Exit codes:
    0 - No forbidden imports found
    1 - Found forbidden Claude/Anthropic imports or dependencies in host-services
