Lint check: Ensure jib-container does not import from host-services.

The container and host are separate security domains with different trust levels.
Container code should NOT import from host-services because:

1. Architecture: The container is meant to be self-contained and portable
2. Docker builds: Container code is baked into the Docker image; host-services is not
3. Security boundary: host-services may contain code that assumes host-level access
4. Clarity: Makes dependencies explicit and prevents accidental coupling

CORRECT patterns:
    - Import from within jib-container/ (e.g., from claude import run_claude)
    - Import from jib-container/jib-tasks/analysis/utilities/ for shared utilities
    - Standard library and pip-installed packages

INCORRECT patterns:
    - Importing from host-services/ directory
    - Using sys.path manipulation to access host-services

This script is intended to be run as a CI check or pre-commit hook.

See: jib-container/.claude/rules/host-container-boundary.md

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-container-host-boundary.py

Exit codes:
    0 - No forbidden imports found
    1 - Found forbidden host-services imports in jib-container
