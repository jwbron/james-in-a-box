"""
Policy Engine - Ownership and access control checks.

Enforces policies for git/gh operations:
- Branch ownership (bot): jib can push to jib-prefixed branches OR branches with PRs by jib/configured-user/trusted-user
- Branch ownership (incognito): user can push to new branches OR branches with PRs by jib/configured-user
- PR creation: allowed in bot mode, blocked in incognito mode (user creates PRs manually)
- PR comments: jib can comment on any PR
- PR edit/close: jib can only modify PRs it created or PRs by configured user
- Merge blocked: No merge operations allowed (human must merge)

Configuration:
- GATEWAY_TRUSTED_USERS: Comma-separated list of GitHub usernames whose branches
  jib is allowed to push to (e.g., "jwbron,octocat")
- Configured user: The incognito user from repositories.yaml, treated as an owner in both modes
