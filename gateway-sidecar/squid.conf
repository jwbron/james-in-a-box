# Squid proxy configuration for network lockdown (private mode)
#
# This configuration implements SNI-based domain filtering with peek/splice.
# The proxy reads the Server Name Indication (SNI) from TLS ClientHello to determine
# the destination hostname, then either:
# - SPLICES allowed domains (pass-through, no MITM, privacy preserved)
# - TERMINATES non-allowed domains (blocks)
#
# Note: Anthropic API traffic is NOT routed through this proxy. Claude Code uses
# ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL to send API requests directly to the gateway HTTP endpoint,
# which injects credentials and forwards to Anthropic over HTTPS. This approach:
# - No SSL MITM needed for Anthropic traffic
# - No CA certificate trust required in container for Anthropic
# - Gateway handles credential injection transparently
#
# Key security properties:
# - Allowed domains pass through without decryption (privacy preserved)
# - Hostname validation via SNI
# - Direct IP connections blocked
# - All blocked requests logged for audit
