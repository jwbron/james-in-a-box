# Allowed domains for Phase 2 network lockdown
# These are the only domains the jib container can access through the proxy
#
# Format: One domain per line, supports subdomains via .domain.com syntax
# Lines starting with # are comments

# Reference: ADR-Internet-Tool-Access-Lockdown.md Phase 2

# IMPORTANT: GitHub domains are intentionally NOT in this allowlist.
# All GitHub/git access MUST go through the gateway sidecar's git/gh wrappers
# (via REST API at jib-gateway:9847), not directly through the proxy.
# This ensures policy enforcement (branch ownership, merge blocking, etc.)
# cannot be bypassed by direct API calls.
#
# The gateway sidecar holds the GitHub token and enforces:
# - Branch ownership policy (jib can only push to jib-owned branches)
# - Merge blocking (jib cannot merge PRs - human must merge via GitHub UI)
# - Force push blocking (jib cannot force push)
# - Audit logging for all operations

# Note: PyPI, npm, and other package managers are intentionally NOT included
# All dependencies must be pre-installed in the Docker image
# This prevents supply chain attacks and ensures reproducible builds
