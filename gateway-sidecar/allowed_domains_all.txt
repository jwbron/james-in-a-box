# Allow all network traffic mode
# This file permits all domain access through the proxy
#
# SECURITY WARNING: When this mode is enabled:
# - The jib container can access ANY internet destination
# - Only public repositories should be accessible (not private)
# - Private Repo Mode enforcement is handled separately at the gateway API layer
#
# This mode is intended for scenarios where broad internet access is needed
# but repository access should still be restricted to public repos only.
#
# Reference: ADR-Internet-Tool-Access-Lockdown.md
#
# The wildcard domain ".any" with regex matching allows all hostnames

# Wildcard - allow all domains
# Squid uses regex matching with dstdom_regex ACL type for wildcards
# This is configured in squid-allow-all.conf
