"""
User-friendly error messages for Private Repo Mode.

Provides clear, actionable error messages that explain:
1. What operation was blocked
2. Why it was blocked
3. What the user can do instead

These messages are designed to be helpful for AI agents that may need
to adjust their behavior based on policy restrictions.

Security Note:
    In production environments, detailed error messages may leak information
    about repository existence and visibility. Set VERBOSE_ERRORS=false to
    use generic messages that don't reveal repository details.
