# Context Watcher Notifications

Storage for notifications generated by context watcher.

## Purpose

This directory stores notification files created when context watcher analyzes new/changed files.

## File Format

Notifications are markdown files:
```
YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-topic.md
```

## Lifecycle

1. **Created**: When context analysis completes
2. **Detected**: By Slack notifier (if running)
3. **Posted**: To Slack channel
4. **Archived**: Moved to archive after posting

## Manual Review

Check this directory for:
- Recent analysis results
- Unposted notifications (if notifier is down)
- Historical analysis records

## Cleanup

Files are automatically archived after posting. Old archives can be cleaned manually:
```bash
find ~/.jib-sharing/notifications/archive -mtime +30 -delete
```
