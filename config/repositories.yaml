# Repository Configuration for james-in-a-box (jib)
#
# This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for which repositories jib has
# read/write access to. All components should import this config rather than
# hardcoding repository names.
#
# Usage:
# - Python: from config.repo_config import get_writable_repos, is_writable_repo
# - Bash/Scripts: parse this YAML or use the helper script
# - Claude Rules: Reference this file for up-to-date repo list
#
# Access Levels:
# - writable: jib can respond to comments, push changes, create PRs
# - readable: jib can sync and analyze but not modify (future)

# Repositories where jib has WRITE access
# These are repos where jib can:
# - Respond to PR comments
# - Push code changes
# - Create PRs via create-pr-helper.py
# - Implement fixes for failed CI checks
writable_repos:
  - jwbron/james-in-a-box

# Default reviewer for PRs created by jib
default_reviewer: jwiesebron

# GitHub sync configuration
github_sync:
  # Whether to sync all PRs in writable repos (true) or just user's PRs (false)
  sync_all_prs: true

  # Sync interval in minutes (used by systemd timer)
  sync_interval_minutes: 5

# Future: Repositories with read-only access
# readable_repos:
#   - khan/webapp
#   - khan/mobile
