- Monitor and address issues after release

**We know our product and deliver impact**
- Develop user empathy (classroom visits, user interviews, support work)
- Use empirical data from user and efficacy research
- Combine user understanding with product knowledge and business goals
- Drive learning success through better software

**We build for the long run**
- Build quality software from day one
- Give early feedback, define realistic timelines
- Use code quality tools and checklists
- Maintain standards throughout development

### 2. We Nurture Every Engineer

**We help each other grow**
- Collaborative pairing, formalized mentorship, extensive code reviews
- Internal and external professional development
- Create growth opportunities aligned with interests and goals
- Support venturing outside comfort zones

**We value engineer productivity and satisfaction**
- Keep code understandable and tidy
- Automate best practices, catch bugs early
- Continually modernize dependencies, refactor, add tests, delete unused code
- Code should be a pleasure to work with
- Measure and improve engineer satisfaction

### 3. We Collaborate Compassionately

**We engage considerately with one another**
- Treat colleagues with dignity and respect
- Make sure everyone has a voice
- Assume colleagues are skillful, honor their efforts
- Code reviews are supportive, informative, focused on growth
- Address concerns as they arise, expect meaningful change

**We share efficiently and effectively**
- Include diverse voices in every decision
- Share information with everyone who needs it
- Proactively share decision records
- Stand up for beliefs but stay humble and seek new information
- Ensure everyone is heard and acknowledged

**We cultivate a community**
- All are welcome, team should reflect diversity of communities served
- Take actions that bring us closer together
- Make space for fun and traditions
