# Run weekly on Monday at 11:00 AM (system local time)
OnCalendar=Mon *-*-* 11:00:00

# If system was off when timer should have run, run it on next boot
# (Persistent=true handles this - no need for OnBootSec which causes
# unwanted runs every time the timer is restarted via setup.sh)

# Randomize start time by up to 5 minutes to avoid resource spikes
