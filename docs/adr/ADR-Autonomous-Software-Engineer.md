## Context

### Background

**Problem Statement:**

Engineering teams face several interconnected challenges:
1. **Limited Capacity:** Engineers spend significant time on routine tasks (code reviews, refactoring, documentation, test writing)
2. **Context Switching:** Frequent interruptions reduce deep work time
3. **Code Quality:** Maintaining consistent standards across growing codebase
4. **Developer Experience:** Engineers want to focus on strategic, creative work
5. **Knowledge Transfer:** Institutional knowledge locked in documentation and tickets
6. **Mobile Productivity:** Engineers often unavailable at desk but want to stay productive

**Opportunity:**

Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude have demonstrated strong capabilities in:
- Code generation and refactoring
- Documentation writing
- Test creation
- Code review and analysis
- Following complex instructions
- Learning from context and examples

### What We're Deciding

This ADR establishes the architecture, security model, and operational patterns for deploying an **LLM-powered autonomous software engineering agent** that can:

1. Work independently on well-defined tasks
2. Generate production-quality code
3. Create comprehensive documentation
4. Perform code analysis and suggest improvements
5. Interact naturally with engineers via Slack (including from mobile devices)
6. Create pull requests ready for review and merge
7. Continuously learn and improve

### Goals

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Increase Engineering Capacity:** Handle routine tasks autonomously
2. **Improve Code Quality:** Consistent standards, comprehensive tests, better documentation
3. **Enable Mobile Productivity:** Engineers can manage agent and review output from phone
4. **Enhance Developer Experience:** Let engineers focus on strategic, creative work
5. **Reduce Cognitive Load:** Agent handles context gathering, boilerplate, repetitive work
6. **Accelerate Delivery:** Faster iteration on well-defined features

**Non-Goals:**
- Replace human engineers
- Make architectural decisions without human input
- Deploy to production without human review
- Handle ambiguous or under-specified requirements alone
- Bypass security controls or code review processes

### Key Requirements

**Functional:**
1. **Autonomous Operation:** Work independently for hours on clear tasks
2. **Quality Output:** Production-ready code, tests, and documentation
3. **Context Awareness:** Access to JIRA, Confluence, codebase, recent changes
4. **Natural Interaction:** Conversational interface via Slack
5. **Reviewable Output:** All work easily reviewable by humans
6. **Mobile-First Review:** Engineer can review, approve, and manage from phone

**Non-Functional:**
1. **Security:** Zero access to credentials or production systems
2. **Safety:** Cannot deploy, push, or modify production without human approval
3. **Reliability:** Consistent, predictable behavior
4. **Observability:** Full visibility into what the agent is doing
5. **Maintainability:** System easy to understand and modify

## Decision

**We will build a Docker-sandboxed Claude Code agent ("james-in-a-box") with mobile-first interaction and safe automated PR creation.**

### Core Architecture

**1. Isolation Strategy: Docker Sandbox**
- Agent runs in isolated Docker container
- **No credentials:** SSH keys, cloud tokens, secrets excluded
- **Code access:** Read-write mount of codebase (agent commits locally)
- **Network isolation:** Outbound HTTP only (Claude API, packages)
- **Human-gated operations:** Deploy requires human action; PR creation safe-guarded

**Rationale:** Maximum security with operational flexibility. Agent can work freely on code but cannot affect production.

**2. Integration Strategy: Slack as Primary Interface (Mobile-First)**
- **Bidirectional Slack messaging** for task assignment and updates
- **Mobile-optimized notifications** with inline previews
- **PR creation from mobile:** Agent creates PR via GitHub API, engineer reviews and merges from phone
- **Thread-based conversations** for context maintenance
- **Quick action buttons** for approve/reject/defer decisions

**Rationale:** Slack is where engineers already work. Low friction, immediate adoption, excellent mobile support. Engineer can be fully productive from phone.

**3. Context Strategy: Multi-Source with Evolution Path**
- **Current (Phase 1):** Confluence docs and JIRA tickets synced to local markdown
- **Markdown format:** LLM-friendly, version-controllable
- **Scheduled sync:** Every 15-30 minutes (cron)
- **Near-term evolution (Phase 2-3):** Expand to real-time and cloud-based context sources

**Rationale:** File-based sync is fastest path to MVP and sufficient for most workflows. However, we acknowledge limitations (not real-time, one-way sync). **Recommendation:** Assess hybrid approach using:
- **MCP servers** for real-time context access (JIRA updates, GitHub activity)
- **API calls** for bi-directional updates (comment on PRs, update ticket status)
- **GCP read-only access** for production context (logs, metrics, monitoring data)
- **File-based sync** retained for bulk Confluence documentation

**GCP Integration (Phase 2-3):**
- **Limited-scope service accounts:** Read-only access to specific GCP resources
- **Cloud Logging:** Error patterns, application logs for debugging context
- **Cloud Monitoring:** Performance metrics, system health indicators
- **Cloud Storage:** Configuration snapshots (non-sensitive)
- **BigQuery:** Usage analytics, performance data
- **Security:** No Secret Manager access, no write permissions, audit all reads

**4. Continuous Improvement: Automated Analyzers**
- **Codebase Analyzer:** Weekly analysis for code quality, security, structure
- **Conversation Analyzer:** Daily analysis of agent interactions for prompt improvement
- Output guides refinements to system prompts and agent behavior

**Rationale:** System gets better over time without manual intervention. Data-driven improvement.

**5. Mobile-First PR Workflow (Core Requirement)**
- **Agent prepares:** Complete PR with description, tests, documentation
- **Agent creates PR:** Uses GitHub API with PR-creation-scoped token, tags engineer
- **Mobile review:** Engineer reviews on phone via Slack notification
- **Quick actions:** Approve, request changes, or defer from Slack
- **Human merges:** Final merge approval remains with human

**Rationale:** Engineers are often away from desk. Mobile productivity is essential for adoption and engineer satisfaction.

**6. Deployment Strategy: Local-First, Cloud-Native Future**
- **Current (Phase 1):** Runs on engineer's laptop for pilot/development
- **Rationale:** Fastest iteration, easiest debugging, no cloud infrastructure needed for MVP
- **Future (Phase 3):** Deploy to Cloud Run using Terraform
  - **Stateless containers:** Agent instances are ephemeral
  - **Persistent storage:** Code mounts via Cloud Storage FUSE or NFS
  - **Service orchestration:** Systemd → Cloud Run jobs/services
  - **IAM integration:** Workload Identity (no service account key files)
  - **Scaling:** Multi-engineer support via container instances
  - **Terraform managed:** Infrastructure as code, same deploy process as other services

**Rationale:** Start on laptop to validate quickly, evolve to cloud-native infrastructure for production scale and multi-engineer support.

**7. Agent Demeanor and Cultural Alignment: Khan Academy Engineering Standards**
- **Current approach:** Agent behavior defined by `jib-container/.claude/rules/` configuration files
- **Core principle:** Agent should embody Khan Academy engineering values and expectations
- **Implementation:**
  - Load Khan Academy engineering guidelines from Confluence docs
  - Software Engineer level expectations (L3, L4, L5 criteria)
  - Code quality standards and best practices
  - Communication style (clarity, precision, collaboration)
  - Problem-solving approach (systematic, data-driven, user-focused)
- **Continuous refinement:** Conversation analyzer evaluates tone, collaboration quality, technical communication
- **Configuration location:** `jib-container/.claude/rules/khan-academy-culture.md` references Confluence guidelines

**Rationale:** Agent effectiveness depends on cultural fit, not just technical capability. Khan Academy has specific expectations for engineers (thoroughness, clarity, user empathy, collaborative problem-solving). Agent should demonstrate these values in all interactions. Using Confluence-documented standards ensures alignment with actual organizational expectations.

**Example Integration:**
```markdown
# jib-container/.claude/rules/khan-academy-culture.md

## Khan Academy Engineering Values (from Confluence)

### Technical Excellence
- Write clear, maintainable code (not clever code)
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, edge cases)
- Documentation that explains "why" not just "what"
- Performance-conscious but not prematurely optimized

### Communication Standards
- Concise technical writing (clarity over verbosity)
- Data-driven recommendations (metrics, evidence)
- Proactive progress updates (don't wait to be asked)
- Honest about uncertainty ("I don't know" over guessing)

### Problem-Solving Approach
- User impact first (how does this help learners/teachers?)
- Systematic debugging (reproduce, isolate, fix, test)
- Consider edge cases and failure modes
- Security and accessibility by default

### Collaboration Style
- Respectful code review feedback (constructive, specific)
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements unclear
- Escalate blockers early (don't thrash alone)
- Share knowledge (document learnings for team)

### Software Engineer Level Expectations
Reference: ~/confluence-docs/ENG/Career-Framework/

L3 (Mid-level): Execute well-defined projects, ask good questions
L4 (Senior): Lead projects, mentor, architectural input
L5 (Staff): Cross-team impact, technical strategy

Agent should demonstrate L3-L4 behaviors:
- Break down complex tasks independently (L3)
- Identify risks and trade-offs proactively (L4)
- Produce production-ready code with minimal iteration (L4)
- Document decisions and rationale (L3-L4)
```

**Benefits:**
- Agent behavior aligns with team norms
- Output quality matches organizational expectations
- Communication style familiar to engineers
- Cultural consistency across human and agent work
- Easier adoption (feels like working with a Khan engineer)

### Decision Matrix

| Area | Chosen Approach | Key Rationale | Rejected Alternatives |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Execution Environment** | Docker sandbox with no credentials | Security, isolation, safe experimentation | VM isolation, cloud workstation, direct host access |
| **LLM Provider** | Anthropic Claude (Code-optimized) | Code quality, context window, tool use, safety | OpenAI GPT-4, self-hosted Llama, multiple providers |

| **Code Management** | Git commits in sandbox, human approves PR | Safety, review-before-merge, audit trail | Agent pushes directly, squash commits, no git |
| **PR Creation** | Agent creates PR, human merges (mobile-friendly) | Balance automation and safety, mobile productivity | Fully autonomous merge, PR description only, no automation |
| **Deployment Model** | Human reviews and approves all changes | Safety, learning opportunity, regulatory compliance | Fully autonomous deployment, staged rollout, feature flags |
| **Improvement Mechanism** | Automated analyzers with prompt refinement | Data-driven, continuous improvement, low overhead | Manual tuning, A/B testing, user feedback only |
| **Infrastructure Deployment** | Laptop (Phase 1), Cloud Run via Terraform (Phase 3) | Fast MVP iteration, scales to cloud-native production | Direct cloud deployment, VM-based, Kubernetes |
| **Cultural Alignment** | Confluence-sourced KA engineering standards in jib-container/.claude/rules/ | Behavior aligns with org values, feels like KA engineer | Generic LLM behavior, manual prompt tuning, no cultural context |

- **Linked context:** JIRA tickets, design docs automatically referenced

**4. Context Sync (Phase 1: File-Based) - Implementation Details**

**Architecture: Host Syncs Data → Container Analyzes**
- **Security Boundary:** Host has credentials, container is credential-free
- **Sync Components:** Run as systemd user services on host
- **Analysis Components:** Run inside container, analyze synced data
- **Communication:** File-based via `~/context-sync/` (read-only in container)

**Implemented Sync Systems:**

**Confluence Sync** (`components/context-sync/connectors/confluence/`)
- **Host Service:** `context-sync.timer` - Runs hourly
- **Source:** Confluence API (ADRs, runbooks, engineering docs)
- **Output:** `~/context-sync/confluence/` - Markdown files
- **Format:** Atlassian Document Format (ADF) → Markdown
- **Connector:** Python-based with incremental sync
- **Container Analysis:** Triggered via `jib --exec --worktree` after sync completes

**JIRA Sync** (`components/context-sync/connectors/jira/`)
- **Host Service:** `context-sync.timer` - Runs hourly (same timer as Confluence)
- **Source:** JIRA API - All open INFRA project tickets
- **JQL Query:** `project = INFRA AND resolution = Unresolved ORDER BY updated DESC`
- **Output:** `~/context-sync/jira/` - Markdown files per ticket
- **Format:** `{KEY}_{SUMMARY}.md` with metadata, description, comments
- **Includes:** All issue types (stories, tasks, bugs, epics)
- **Incremental Sync:** Tracks ticket hashes to avoid re-fetching unchanged tickets
- **Container Analysis:** `jira-watcher.py` triggered via `jib --exec --worktree` after sync

**GitHub Sync** (`components/github-sync/`)
- **Host Service:** `github-sync.timer` - Runs every 15 minutes
- **Source:** GitHub API (PR data, checks, comments)
- **Output:** `~/context-sync/github/` - JSON files
- **Structure:**
  - `prs/{repo}-PR-{num}.json` - PR metadata and diffs

  - `comments/{repo}-PR-{num}-comments.json` - PR comments for response tracking
- **Scope:** Only PRs opened by current user (for now)
- **Container Analysis:** `check-monitor.py` triggered via `jib --exec --worktree` after sync

**Container-Side Active Analysis:**

**Context Watcher** (`jib-container/components/context-watcher/`)
- **Architecture:** Exec-based pattern triggered by `context-sync.service` via `jib --exec --worktree`
- **JIRA Watcher:** Analyzes new/updated tickets after hourly sync
  - Extracts action items from descriptions
  - Estimates scope (small/medium/large)
  - Identifies dependencies and risks
  - Creates Beads tasks automatically
  - Sends Slack notifications with summaries
- **Confluence Watcher:** Monitors high-value docs after hourly sync
  - Focuses on ADRs and runbooks
  - Detects decision keywords, deprecations, migrations
  - Identifies impact on current work
  - Creates Beads tasks for ADRs
  - Sends Slack notifications

**GitHub Watcher** (`jib-container/components/github-watcher/`)
- **Architecture:** Exec-based pattern triggered by `github-sync.service` via `jib --exec --worktree`
- **Check Monitor:** Analyzes PR check failures after sync (every 15 min), suggests automated fixes
- **Comment Responder (Phase 3):** Analyzes PR comments, suggests responses
- **Scope:** Only user's own PRs currently

**Sprint Analysis** (`jib-container/scripts/analyze-sprint.py`)
- **On-Demand:** Execute via `bin/jib --exec`
- **Analyzes:** Currently assigned JIRA tickets
- **Groups:** By status (In Progress, In Review, Blocked, To Do)
- **Suggests:** Next steps for each ticket, backlog tickets to pull in
- **Scoring:** Prioritizes by urgency, clarity, and recent activity
- **Output:** Slack notification with actionable recommendations

**5. Context Evolution (Phase 2-3: MCP + APIs + GCP)**
- **MCP Servers:** Real-time context access for JIRA, GitHub, monitoring
- **API Calls:** Bi-directional updates (comment on PRs, update tickets)
- **GCP Read-Only Access:** Production logs, metrics, analytics via service accounts
- **Hybrid approach:** File-based for bulk docs, real-time for critical updates, cloud data for operational context

**6. Automated Analyzers**
- **Codebase Analyzer:** Weekly code quality analysis
- **Conversation Analyzer:** Daily interaction analysis
- **Output:** Recommendations for prompt/system improvements
- **Runs:** Systemd timers, containerized via `jib --exec`

**7. File Watchers**
- **Notifications:** `~/sharing/notifications/` → Slack
- **Incoming Tasks:** `~/sharing/incoming/` → Agent pickup
- **Tracking:** State management for async workflows

### Persistent Memory & State Management

**Challenge:** LLMs are stateless - each conversation starts fresh. Without persistent memory:
- Work interruptions mean lost context
- Container restarts lose all progress
- Multiple concurrent containers can duplicate work
- No knowledge of what's already been done
- Cannot resume interrupted tasks

**Solution: Beads (Git-Backed Task Memory)**

Beads provides automatic persistent memory for the agent, solving the "LLM amnesia" problem:

**Architecture:**
```
~/.jib-sharing/beads/          # Host storage (persists across rebuilds)
├── issues.jsonl               # Task database (source of truth)
├── .git/                      # Version history
└── .beads.sqlite             # SQLite cache (disposable, auto-rebuilt)
       ↑
       │ Git sync
       │
Container 1: ~/beads/          # Symlink, shares same git repo
Container 2: ~/beads/          # Another container, same repo
Container N: ~/beads/          # All containers coordinate
```

**Automatic Workflow Integration:**

Agent automatically (without being asked):
1. **On startup:** Check for in-progress tasks (`bd list --status in-progress`)
2. **On new task:** Create Beads entry (`bd add "Implement OAuth2 for JIRA-1234"`)
3. **During work:** Update status and notes (`bd update bd-a3f8 --status in-progress`)
4. **Multi-step tasks:** Break into subtasks with dependencies
5. **On completion:** Mark done, unblock dependent tasks

**Key Features:**
- **Git-backed:** All changes versioned, can review history
- **Multi-container safe:** Hash-based IDs (bd-a3f8) prevent conflicts
- **Dependency tracking:** Tasks can block other tasks
- **Parent-child relationships:** Complex features broken into subtasks
- **Automatic resumption:** Agent picks up where it left off after restarts
- **Cross-session memory:** Context preserved indefinitely

**Example Workflow:**

```bash
# Engineer sends: "Implement OAuth2 authentication for JIRA-1234"
# Agent automatically:

cd ~/beads
bd list --search "OAuth2 JIRA-1234"  # Check if already exists
bd add "Implement OAuth2 for JIRA-1234" --tags feature,jira-1234,slack
bd update bd-a3f8 --status in-progress

# Break into subtasks
bd add "Design auth schema" --parent bd-a3f8
bd add "Implement OAuth2 endpoints" --parent bd-a3f8 --add-blocker bd-b1
bd add "Write integration tests" --parent bd-a3f8 --add-blocker bd-b2,bd-b3

# Work on tasks, update progress
bd update bd-b1 --status done
bd update bd-b1 --notes "Schema designed per ADR-042, using httpOnly cookies"
bd update bd-b2 --remove-blocker bd-b1  # Unblock next task

# Container crashes/restarts...

# On resume:
bd list --status in-progress
# Shows: bd-a3f8 "Implement OAuth2..." and remaining subtasks
bd show bd-a3f8  # Read all previous notes and context
# Continue work seamlessly
```

**Benefits:**
- **No lost work:** Container crashes don't lose context
- **Parallel work:** Multiple containers coordinate via shared git repo
- **Progress visibility:** Can check status of all tasks across all sessions
- **Knowledge accumulation:** Notes on decisions, blockers, approaches persist
- **Automatic resumption:** Agent knows exactly where to pick up

**Implementation:**
- **Storage:** `~/.jib-sharing/beads/` (git repository on host)
- **Access:** `~/beads/` symlink in container
- **CLI:** `beads` command (beads-cli package)
- **Format:** JSONL (human-readable, git-friendly)
- **Cache:** SQLite for fast queries (auto-rebuilt each session)

This solves the fundamental "LLM amnesia" problem while enabling true autonomous operation across sessions and containers.

### Exec-Based Analysis Architecture

**Pattern:** Event-driven analysis triggered by host services via `jib --exec`

**Architecture:**
```
Host systemd service syncs data → Triggers analysis via jib --exec
  ↓
Spawn new ephemeral container (docker run --rm)
  ↓
Analysis script runs once → Sends notifications → Exits
  ↓
Container automatically removed (--rm flag)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Event-driven:** Analysis only when data changes (after sync completes)
- **No background processes:** Container has no continuous watchers
- **Total isolation:** Each execution in separate container, can't affect interactive sessions
- **Concurrent safe:** Multiple analyses can run simultaneously without conflicts
- **Automatic cleanup:** Containers removed immediately after exit (--rm flag)
- **Lower resource usage:** No polling loops, scripts exit after completion
- **Simpler debugging:** One-shot executions easier to trace than continuous loops
- **No git complexity:** Mounts main repos directly, no worktree management needed

**Implementation:**
- **github-sync.service:** `ExecStartPost` triggers `check-monitor.py` via `jib --exec`
- **context-sync.service:** `ExecStartPost` triggers `jira-watcher.py` and `confluence-watcher.py`
- **slack-receiver:** Triggers `incoming-processor.py` when message arrives
- **Containers:** Each execution gets unique ID (`jib-exec-{timestamp}-{pid}`)
- **Cleanup:** Automatic via Docker `--rm` flag (no manual cleanup needed)

**Why ephemeral containers over docker exec:**
1. **Isolation:** Cannot affect running Claude Code sessions or other jobs
2. **Simplicity:** No worktree creation/cleanup logic needed
3. **Resource efficiency:** No CPU cycles wasted on polling empty directories
4. **Clearer architecture:** Analysis explicitly coupled to data availability
5. **Better error handling:** Failed analysis doesn't affect container lifecycle
6. **Easier testing:** Can manually trigger analysis via `jib --exec`
7. **Scalability:** Adding new analysis scripts doesn't increase baseline load

## Security Considerations

### Isolation Layers

**Layer 1: Container Isolation**
- Docker container with minimal privileges
- No host network access (bridge mode only)
- No sensitive mounts (SSH keys, cloud credentials excluded)
- Non-root user inside container

**Layer 2: Credential Isolation**
- **No SSH keys:** Cannot push to GitHub directly (uses API for PRs)
- **No deployment credentials:** Cannot deploy to GCP/AWS
- **No production DB access:** No connection strings
- **PR-creation-scoped GitHub token:** Can create PRs and comment, but cannot merge or modify settings
- **Limited GCP service accounts (Phase 2-3):** Read-only, scoped to specific resources only
  - Cloud Logging: Read-only to application logs
  - Cloud Monitoring: Read-only to metrics and dashboards
  - Cloud Storage: Read-only to non-sensitive buckets
  - BigQuery: Read-only to analytics datasets
  - **Excluded:** Secret Manager, write permissions, production data modification
  - **Authentication:** Service account keys (Phase 2-3 laptop), Workload Identity (Phase 3+ Cloud Run)
- **Claude API key:** Scoped to code generation only

**Layer 3: Network Isolation**
- **Outbound only:** HTTP/HTTPS for Claude API, GitHub API, and packages
- **No inbound ports:** Cannot accept connections
- **Bridge networking:** Isolated from host services
- **No VPN:** Cannot access internal networks

**Layer 4: Filesystem Isolation**
- **Code (RW):** Agent can modify, but changes stay local until PR approved
- **Context (RO):** Agent reads but cannot modify source
- **Sharing (RW):** Agent writes output for review
- **Host isolation:** Cannot access host filesystem

### Human-in-the-Loop Controls

**Required Human Approval:**
1. **PR Merge:** Agent creates PR, human must merge
2. **Deployment:** All deployments manual
3. **Credential Use:** Agent never has push credentials
4. **Production Access:** Agent never touches production
5. **Breaking Changes:** Flagged for mandatory detailed review

**Audit Trail:**
- All agent actions logged to systemd journal
- Git history shows agent authorship with Co-Authored-By tag
- Slack threads maintain conversation history
- File system tracks all output with timestamps
- GitHub PR history shows creation by agent, merge by human

### Safe-by-Default Design

**What Agent CAN Do:**
- Read code and documentation
- Generate and test code locally
- Create local git commits
- Create pull requests via GitHub API (PR-creation-scoped token)
- Write analysis and recommendations
- Ask questions via Slack

**What Agent CANNOT Do:**
- Merge pull requests (requires human)
- Push code directly to repositories
- Deploy to any environment
- Access production systems
- Modify credentials or secrets
- Accept inbound connections
- Bypass code review

### Data Exfiltration Concerns

**Critical Security Consideration:** Agent has read access to potentially confidential information (Confluence docs, JIRA tickets, internal code, GCP logs). We must prevent exfiltration of sensitive data.

**Exfiltration Vectors:**

1. **Claude API calls** - Context sent to Anthropic's API
2. **GitHub PR descriptions** - Public or semi-public PRs could leak internal info
3. **Slack notifications** - Posted to Slack channels (potentially broad audience)
4. **Git commit messages** - Commits could reference confidential strategies
5. **File outputs** - Writes to `~/sharing/` could contain sensitive data

**Data at Risk:**

- **Confluence**: Internal ADRs, business strategies, customer information, security practices
- **JIRA**: Customer names, feature roadmaps, revenue data, support tickets
- **Code**: Architecture details, algorithms, API keys in comments, business logic
- **GCP Logs**: Production errors with user data, system internals, performance characteristics
- **Conversations**: Discussions about vulnerabilities, internal processes, unreleased features

**Layered Mitigations:**

**Layer 1: Human Review (Current - Phase 1)**
- ✅ **All PR descriptions reviewed** before human opens PR
- ✅ **All commit messages reviewed** before push
- ✅ **All Slack notifications visible** to engineer before posting
- ✅ **Engineer responsible** for identifying sensitive content
- ⚠️ **Limitation:** Relies on human vigilance, no automated detection

**Layer 2: Context Source Filtering (Phase 2)**
- [ ] **Confluence space allowlist:** Only sync approved public/internal spaces
- [ ] **JIRA project allowlist:** Only sync approved projects (no customer support tickets)
- [ ] **Code repo allowlist:** Only sync approved repositories
- [ ] **GCP resource scoping:** Only logs/metrics from approved services
- [ ] **Exclude patterns:** `.env` files, `/secrets/` directories, customer data repos

**Layer 3: Content Classification (Phase 2-3)**
- [ ] **Document tagging:** Mark Confluence docs as Public/Internal/Confidential
- [ ] **JIRA field classification:** Identify fields with sensitive data
- [ ] **Code scanning:** Detect API keys, tokens, PII in comments
- [ ] **Metadata filtering:** Remove customer identifiers before sync

**Layer 4: DLP Scanning (Phase 3-4)**
- [ ] **Cloud DLP integration:** Scan all context before Claude API calls
- [ ] **Pattern matching:** Detect SSN, credit cards, API keys, customer names
- [ ] **Redaction:** Automatically redact detected sensitive patterns
- [ ] **Alerting:** Flag attempts to reference highly sensitive content
- [ ] **Blocking:** Prevent Claude API calls with unredacted sensitive data

**Layer 5: Output Monitoring (Phase 3-4)**
- [ ] **PR description scanning:** Check for leaked confidential info before creation
- [ ] **Commit message scanning:** Detect sensitive references
- [ ] **Notification scanning:** Check Slack messages for leaks
- [ ] **Audit logging:** Track what data was sent to Claude API
- [ ] **Anomaly detection:** Flag unusual data volumes or patterns

**Current Risk Assessment:**

**Risk Level: MEDIUM (Phase 1)**
- ✅ Human review provides basic protection
- ✅ Network isolation prevents direct exfiltration
- ✅ No direct production access limits exposure
- ⚠️ No automated detection of sensitive content
- ⚠️ Relies on engineer identifying confidential info in PR/commit reviews
- ⚠️ Claude API receives full unfiltered context

**Risk Level: LOW (Phase 3-4 with DLP)**
- ✅ Automated DLP scanning
- ✅ Context source filtering and classification
- ✅ Redaction of known sensitive patterns
- ✅ Output monitoring and blocking
- ✅ Audit trail of data sent externally

**Recommended Immediate Actions (Phase 1):**

1. **Document acceptable context sources**
   - Which Confluence spaces are safe? (Engineering ADRs: YES, Customer contracts: NO)
   - Which JIRA projects? (Internal engineering: YES, Customer support: NO)
   - Which code repos? (Open source + internal tools: YES, Payment processing: NO)

2. **Engineer training**
   - How to identify confidential content in PR descriptions
   - What to look for in commit messages
   - When to reject agent output

3. **Monitoring baseline**
   - Log all Claude API calls (prompt sizes, response sizes)
   - Track what context was included in each session
   - Manual review of logs weekly

4. **Incident response plan**
   - If sensitive data leaked to PR: Close PR, notify security team
   - If sensitive data sent to Claude API: Document incident, assess exposure
   - If pattern detected: Update filters, retrain engineer

**Future Enhancements Timeline:**

**Phase 2:** Source filtering and classification
**Phase 3:** DLP scanning with Cloud DLP, output monitoring, automated redaction

**Anthropic Security Considerations:**

- **Claude API data handling:** Anthropic states they don't train on API data (verify current policy before Phase 2)
- **Data retention:** Anthropic retains API logs for 30 days (verify current policy before Phase 2)
- **Encryption:** All API calls over HTTPS
- **Access control:** API key scoped to our account only
- **Audit:** Anthropic provides usage logs

**Action Required:** Review and document Anthropic's current data handling policies before Phase 2 rollout.

**Trade-off Accepted (Phase 1):**
We accept MEDIUM risk of confidential data exfiltration during pilot phase because:
1. Human reviews all outputs before they become public
2. Agent has no direct production access
3. Network isolation limits exfiltration vectors
4. Pilot scope limited to approved engineers and low-sensitivity repos
5. Benefits outweigh risks for internal engineering work

**Escalation to LOW risk required before:**
- Expanding to customer-facing repos
- Including customer support JIRA projects
- Accessing production GCP logs with user data
- Multi-engineer rollout beyond pilot

**Escalation Approval Process:**
- Security team reviews DLP implementation
- Engineering leadership approves multi-engineer rollout
- Data exfiltration risk assessment documents LOW risk achievement
- Requires: Context filtering + DLP scanning + output monitoring all operational

### Security Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Data exfiltration of confidential information (PRIMARY CONCERN)**

See comprehensive analysis in [Data Exfiltration Concerns](#data-exfiltration-concerns) section above.

**Summary:**
- **Threat:** Agent reads confidential Confluence/JIRA/code/GCP data, could leak via PR descriptions, commits, Slack, or Claude API
- **Impact:** HIGH - Business strategies, customer data, security practices exposed
- **Current Risk:** MEDIUM (Phase 1) - Human review only, no automated detection
- **Target Risk:** LOW (Phase 3) - DLP scanning, source filtering, output monitoring
- **5-Layer Defense:** Human review → Source filtering → Classification → DLP scanning → Output monitoring
- **Escalation:** DLP required before customer-facing repos or multi-engineer rollout

- Git-based code management (fundamental to workflow)
- Human review requirements (core safety principle)
- PR creation workflow (could evolve to more automation)

**Permanent (High Cost to Change):**
- Sandboxed execution model (fundamental security principle)
- Human-in-the-loop for production changes (regulatory, safety requirement)
- Security-first architecture (credential isolation, network isolation)
- Audit logging requirements (compliance, debugging essential)
- Mobile-first design philosophy (affects all UX decisions)

**Review Cadence:**
- **Weekly:** Analyzer output, quick improvements
- **Monthly:** Operational metrics, prompt refinements, mobile UX feedback
- **Quarterly:** Feature priorities, capability additions, context strategy assessment (MCP/API evaluation)
- **Annually:** Architecture review, provider evaluation, security audit

### Safe Autonomous Actions

**Expanded with Safe-Guards:**

**Automated PR Creation (Current Phase):**
- ✅ Safe: Creates PR with tag to engineer
- ✅ Safe: Cannot merge without approval
- ✅ Safe: Read-only GitHub token
- ✅ Safe: All PRs require human review

**Test Execution:**
- ✅ Safe: Run tests in isolated environment
- ✅ Safe: Report results via Slack and in PR
- ✅ Safe: No deployment on success
- ✅ Safe: Failures block "approved-for-merge" label

**Documentation Updates:**
- ✅ Safe: Update docs in PR (requires review)
- ✅ Safe: Link to source code changes
- ✅ Safe: Version control maintained
- ✅ Safe: Review before merge

**Dependency Updates (with constraints):**
- ⚠️ Risky: Requires extensive testing
- ✅ Safe if: Minor/patch versions only
- ✅ Safe if: Full test suite passes
- ✅ Safe if: Human reviews breaking changes
- ✅ Safe if: Rollback plan documented

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Cloud-Based IDE (e.g., GitHub Codespaces, Replit Agent)

**Approach:** Use hosted development environment with LLM integration

**Pros:**
- Managed infrastructure
- Built-in security
- No local setup required
- Integrated with existing tools

**Cons:**
- Less control over environment
- Vendor lock-in
- Limited customization
- Cost at scale
- Credential management still complex
- Mobile experience limited

**Rejected Because:** Need full control for security requirements and custom workflows. Codespaces don't provide credential isolation model we need. Mobile experience not as flexible as Slack.

### Alternative 2: VM-Based Isolation

**Approach:** Run agent in dedicated VM per engineer

**Pros:**
- Stronger isolation than containers
- Can simulate production environment
- More flexibility in networking

**Cons:**
- Higher resource usage
- Slower startup/teardown
- More complex management
- Higher costs

**Rejected Because:** Docker provides sufficient isolation with better resource efficiency and faster iteration.

### Alternative 3: Pure API Integration (Confluence, JIRA, GitHub) - No File Sync

**Approach:** Real-time API calls instead of file-based sync

**Pros:**
- Always up-to-date data
- No sync lag
- Richer data access (comments, history)
- Bi-directional updates possible

**Cons:**
- Complex authentication management
- API rate limits
- More failure modes
- Longer implementation time
- Need error handling for each API
- Higher initial development cost

**Rejected for Phase 1 Because:** File-based sync is faster to implement and sufficient for most use cases. **However, we will assess hybrid approach (MCP servers + APIs) in Phase 2-3** for high-value real-time integrations while keeping file-based for bulk documentation.

### Alternative 4: Self-Hosted Open Source LLM

**Approach:** Deploy Llama 3, CodeLlama, or similar locally

**Pros:**
- No API costs
- Full data control
- No external dependencies
- Customizable model

**Cons:**
- Significant GPU infrastructure required
- Lower code quality than Claude/GPT-4
- Model management overhead
- Fine-tuning complexity
- Limited context window
- Higher operational complexity

**Rejected Because:** Quality gap is significant. API costs are offset by time saved. Can reconsider if costs become prohibitive or open-source capabilities improve significantly.

### Alternative 5: Fully Autonomous (No Human Review)

**Approach:** Agent merges PRs directly to production after tests pass

**Pros:**
- Maximum automation
- Fastest delivery
- No review bottleneck

**Cons:**
- Unacceptable risk level
- Regulatory concerns (code review requirements)
- Debugging difficulty (harder to trace issues)
- Loss of learning opportunity
- Trust building required first
- Security vulnerabilities could reach production

**Rejected Because:** Safety and quality requirements mandate human review. May revisit for specific low-risk scenarios (documentation-only updates, automated dependency patches) after establishing trust and track record.

### Alternative 6: Web UI Instead of Slack

**Approach:** Custom web application for task assignment and review

**Pros:**
- More control over UX
- Richer interfaces possible
- Better for complex reviews (side-by-side diffs)
- Custom workflows easier

**Cons:**
- Another tool to maintain
- Not where engineers already are
- Poor mobile experience without custom app development
- Higher development cost
- Slower adoption (new tool to learn)
- Notification fatigue (separate from Slack)

**Rejected Because:** Slack is where engineers work. Mobile support is critical. Low friction is key to adoption. Can add web UI later for specific advanced workflows (complex code reviews, configuration management), but Slack remains primary interface.

### Alternative 7: PR Description Only (No PR Creation)

**Approach:** Agent generates PR description, human creates PR manually

**Pros:**
- Simpler implementation
- No GitHub API token needed
- Human fully controls PR creation
- Lower security risk

**Cons:**
- Requires engineer at computer (can't do from phone easily)
- More friction in workflow
- Less automation benefit
- Slower iteration

**Rejected Because:** Mobile productivity is core requirement. Creating PR from phone with manual copy-paste is cumbersome. Read-only GitHub token is low-risk. Safe PR creation (agent creates, human merges) provides best balance of automation and safety.
