This document articulates a new paradigm for software development: **human-driven, LLM-navigated**. The core insight is that humans and LLMs have complementary cognitive strengths, and optimal software development emerges when each focuses on what they do best.

**Humans excel at:** Creative problem-solving, strategic decision-making under uncertainty, interpersonal collaboration, intuitive judgment about what matters, and adapting to novel situations.

**LLMs excel at:** Maintaining structural consistency across large codebases, exhaustive enumeration of edge cases, applying established patterns with unwavering precision, synthesizing large amounts of context, and tireless execution of well-defined tasks.

**The goal:** Free human cognitive capacity for creativity, strategic thinking, and healthy collaboration by offloading structural rigor and implementation details to LLMs. This isn't about replacing humans—it's about *amplifying* what makes humans uniquely valuable.

## The Core Philosophy

### Driving vs. Navigating

Consider the analogy of a road trip:

| Role | Responsibility | Cognitive Load |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Driver (Human)** | Decides where to go, when to stop, what route to take | Creative, strategic, social |
| **Navigator (LLM)** | Tracks current position, calculates optimal paths, monitors for hazards | Systematic, exhaustive, precise |

The driver makes the decisions that matter—the destination, the purpose of the journey, whether to take the scenic route. The navigator handles the cognitive burden of tracking every detail, ensuring nothing is missed, and providing accurate information for decision-making.

Neither role is subordinate to the other. Both are essential. But they require fundamentally different cognitive capabilities.

### The Problem with Traditional Development

Traditional software development places an enormous cognitive burden on humans:

```

│                            │  • Is the documentation current?  │
│                            │  • Did I miss any edge cases?     │
│                            │                                   │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The majority of cognitive effort goes toward ensuring correctness, consistency, and completeness—tasks that require exhaustive attention to detail rather than creative insight.

## The Workflow in Practice

### Phase 1: Human Initiates with Intent

The human expresses what they want to accomplish, not necessarily how:

```
"I want to add granular permission scopes to our API so partners can request only the access they need"
```

This is *driving*: the human decides the destination based on business needs.

### Phase 2: LLM Navigates the Solution Space

The LLM exhaustively explores the solution space:

- What existing patterns does the codebase use for authorization?
- What are the security implications of different scope hierarchies?
- Which components need to be modified?
- What edge cases must be handled (scope inheritance, partial access, etc.)?
- What do industry best practices recommend?

This is *navigating*: systematic, thorough exploration of all paths.

### Phase 3: Human Makes Strategic Decisions

The LLM presents options with trade-offs. The human decides:

- "Keep scope hierarchies flat to reduce complexity"
- "We'll accept some increased verbosity to support fine-grained permissions"
- "Let's prioritize clarity over backward compatibility"

This is *driving*: the human makes the judgment calls.

### Phase 4: LLM Executes with Precision

Given the strategic decisions, the LLM implements with unwavering consistency:

- Applies the chosen pattern across all relevant components
- Generates tests covering the specified edge cases
- Updates documentation to reflect the new behavior
- Ensures the implementation matches the codebase's conventions

This is *navigating*: precise execution of the charted course.

### Phase 5: Human Reviews and Approves

The human reviews the implementation with fresh eyes:

- Does this match my intent?
- Are there any concerns I didn't anticipate?
- Is this something I'm comfortable deploying?

This is *driving*: the human has final authority.

## Benefits for Humans

### Cognitive Relief

When LLMs handle the exhaustive details, humans experience:

- **Reduced mental fatigue** - No more tracking every edge case
- **Fewer context switches** - Stay in strategic thinking mode
- **Less anxiety about oversights** - Trust that the navigator is watching
- **More sustainable work patterns** - Creative energy isn't depleted by routine tasks

### Focus on High-Value Work

With cognitive load reduced, humans can focus on:

- **Innovation** - Exploring new approaches and capabilities
- **Mentorship** - Developing other team members
- **Architecture** - Shaping the long-term direction
- **Stakeholder relationships** - Understanding and serving user needs

### Better Decision Quality

When humans aren't mentally exhausted by implementation details:

- **Clearer strategic thinking** - Full cognitive capacity for important decisions
- **Better judgment** - Not rushing to "just get it done"
- **More thoughtful review** - Actually reviewing, not rubber-stamping
- **Healthier skepticism** - Questioning assumptions and approaches

---

## Benefits for Teams

### Healthier Collaboration

When humans aren't cognitively overloaded:

- **More patience** - Bandwidth for thoughtful discussion
- **Better communication** - Energy for explaining and listening
- **Reduced conflict** - Less stress-driven friction
- **Stronger relationships** - Time for the human side of teamwork

### Knowledge Democratization

When structural rigor is automated:

- **Lower barrier to contribution** - Focus on ideas, not implementation details
- **Faster onboarding** - New team members can contribute strategically sooner
- **Reduced bus factor** - Knowledge is captured in systems, not just heads
- **More inclusive participation** - Different cognitive styles can contribute

### Sustainable Pace

When the cognitive burden is shared with LLMs:

- **Consistent velocity** - Not dependent on heroic effort
- **Reduced burnout** - Sustainable work patterns
- **Better work-life balance** - Mental energy left at end of day
- **Long-term team health** - Sustainable for years, not just sprints

## Rigor Through Interactive Planning

The most significant benefit of LLM-navigated development isn't faster code—it's **enforced rigor** that would be impractical for humans alone. When LLMs drive the planning process through structured dialogue, they introduce consistency and thoroughness that transforms how software gets built.

### The Interactive Planning Framework

For complex changes, an LLM-powered planning framework ensures nothing is missed:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Rigor Matters

**Without LLM-driven planning:** Requirements remain vague until implementation reveals gaps. Design decisions happen implicitly during coding. Edge cases discovered in production. Documentation lags behind reality.

**With LLM-driven planning:** Requirements interrogated before any code is written. Design decisions made explicitly with documented trade-offs. Edge cases enumerated systematically during design. Documentation created as a byproduct of the planning process.

### Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints

The framework introduces structured moments where human judgment is required:

| Phase | What LLM Presents | What Human Decides |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Elicitation** | Clarified requirements with assumptions stated | "Yes, that's what I want" or corrections |
| **Design** | 2-3 approaches with trade-offs | Which approach fits the situation |
| **Planning** | Phased implementation with dependencies | Scope, priority, timing |

These checkpoints prevent the LLM from going too far down the wrong path while keeping humans focused on strategic decisions rather than implementation details.

### The Rigor Compounds

Each project that goes through this framework:
- **Codifies organizational knowledge** - Decisions and rationale are captured
- **Raises the quality floor** - Even routine work gets systematic treatment
- **Builds institutional memory** - Past decisions inform future ones
- **Trains the team** - Engineers internalize thorough planning habits

### Making Implicit Knowledge Explicit

Engineering organizations often rely on implicit knowledge—"everyone knows we don't do it that way." The Interactive Planning Framework surfaces these assumptions by requiring explicit specification during the Elicitation phase, which then becomes available to all team members and future LLM interactions.

See: [ADR: Interactive Planning Framework](../adr/in-progress/ADR-Interactive-Planning-Framework.md) for the complete technical specification.

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Interactive Planning

For complex changes, use structured dialogue:

1. **Human states intent** - What outcome is desired?
2. **LLM explores comprehensively** - What are all the considerations?
3. **Human makes decisions** - Which path forward?
4. **LLM implements precisely** - Execute the chosen path
5. **Human reviews and approves** - Final authority

See: [ADR: Interactive Planning Framework](../adr/in-progress/ADR-Interactive-Planning-Framework.md)

### Pattern 2: Structured Handoffs

For routine changes, use well-defined interfaces:

```yaml
# Task handoff from human to LLM
intent: "Add rate limiting to the API"
constraints:
  - "Must not break existing clients"
  - "Prefer Redis for distributed rate limiting"
  - "Start with 100 requests/minute default"
success_criteria:
  - "Tests pass"
  - "Documentation updated"
  - "No performance regression"
```

### Pattern 3: Review Checkpoints

For autonomous work, define where human judgment is required:

| Checkpoint | Trigger | Human Decision |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Architecture** | New component needed | Approve design |
| **Security** | Auth/authz changes | Verify approach |
| **API** | Breaking changes | Approve migration |
| **Scope** | Task growing | Continue or split |

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Abdication

**Problem:** Human fully delegates without reviewing

```
Human: "Just fix whatever you think needs fixing"
       [Never reviews the result]
```

**Why it fails:** LLMs can be confidently wrong. Human judgment is essential.

**Solution:** Humans review all changes, even if briefly.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Micromanagement

**Problem:** Human dictates every implementation detail

```
Human: "Use a for loop, not map. Name the variable 'items', not 'data'.
        Put the function on line 42..."
```

**Why it fails:** Wastes human cognitive capacity on low-value decisions.

**Solution:** Specify intent and constraints; let LLM choose implementation details.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Rubber Stamping

**Problem:** Human approves without genuine review

```
Human: "LGTM" [after 30 seconds on a 500-line change]
```

**Why it fails:** Defeats the purpose of human oversight.

**Solution:** Reviews should be substantive; if too rushed, the workflow needs adjustment.

### Anti-Pattern 4: LLM as Oracle

**Problem:** Treating LLM output as authoritative truth

```
Human: "The LLM said this is the best approach, so it must be"
```

**Why it fails:** LLMs can hallucinate, be outdated, or miss context.

**Solution:** LLM provides options and information; human makes decisions.

## A Note on Naming

This philosophy could be called several things:

- **Human-Driven, LLM-Navigated Development** - Emphasizes the driver/navigator metaphor
- **Cognitive Partnership Development** - Emphasizes the complementary strengths
- **Amplified Development** - Emphasizes human capabilities being enhanced
- **Sustainable AI-Augmented Development** - Emphasizes the long-term human benefits

The name matters less than the principle: **humans focus on what humans do best; LLMs handle what LLMs do best; the result is greater than either alone.**
