# Event_Driven Patterns (Status Quo)

> Auto-generated by jib on 2025-12-01. Review before relying on.

## Current Implementation

### Event Driven

Event-driven architecture with watchers and handlers

### Code Examples

Implementation examples found in:

- `host-services/slack/slack-receiver/host_command_handler.py:43`
- `jib-container/jib-tasks/github/command-handler.py:16`
- `jib-container/jib-tasks/slack/incoming-processor.py:82`
- `jib-container/jib-tools/github-app-token.py:101`
- `tests/host_services/test_utilities.py:16`
- `tests/host_services/test_utilities.py:64`
- `tests/jib_tasks/test_confluence_watcher.py:12`
- `tests/jib_tasks/test_github_processor.py:325`
- `tests/jib_tasks/test_jira_watcher.py:12`
- `tests/run_tests.py:59`

## Conventions

- Watchers monitor external sources (GitHub, Slack, file system)
- Handlers process events and trigger actions
- Use asyncio for concurrent event processing when appropriate
