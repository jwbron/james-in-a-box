> Auto-generated by jib on 2025-11-29.

## Overview

Event-driven architecture with watchers and handlers

## Usage

- Watchers monitor external sources (GitHub, Slack, file system)
- Handlers process events and trigger actions
- Use asyncio for concurrent event processing when appropriate

## Examples

- `host-services/slack/slack-receiver/host_command_handler.py:43`
- `jib-container/jib-tasks/github/command-handler.py:16`
- `jib-container/jib-tasks/slack/incoming-processor.py:82`
- `jib-container/jib-tools/github-app-token.py:101`
- `tests/host_services/test_utilities.py:16`
