# GitHub Watcher

Container-side component that provides comprehensive GitHub PR automation.

**Type**: Exec-based analysis (triggered by github-sync.service)
**Capabilities**:
- **Failure Monitoring**: Detect CI/CD failures, analyze logs, auto-implement fixes
- **Auto-Review**: Automatically review new PRs from others (`--watch` mode)
- **Code Review**: Generate comprehensive on-demand PR reviews
- **Comment Response**: Automatically suggest responses to PR comments

## Overview

GitHub Watcher runs inside the jib container and analyzes `~/context-sync/github/` (synced by the host-side github-sync component). It is triggered via `jib --exec` after each github-sync run and provides three main capabilities:

1. **Check Monitor** - Detects CI/CD failures and suggests/implements fixes
2. **PR Reviewer** - Auto-reviews new PRs from others (watch mode)
3. **Comment Responder** - Suggests responses to comments on your PRs

## Execution Model

```
github-sync.service completes
        ↓
Triggers via ExecStartPost:
  jib --exec python3 check-monitor.py
  jib --exec python3 pr-reviewer.py --watch
  jib --exec python3 comment-responder.py
        ↓
Each script runs in ephemeral container, analyzes data, exits
        ↓
Notifications sent to ~/sharing/notifications/ → Slack
```

## Check Monitor (`check-monitor.py`)

Analyzes CI/CD check failures and suggests or implements fixes.

```
~/context-sync/github/checks/repo-PR-123-checks.json
        ↓
check-monitor.py (runs after github-sync)
        ↓
Detects new failure (not previously notified)
        ↓
Creates Beads task (bd-a3f8: "Fix PR #123 check failures")
        ↓
Analyzes logs for patterns:
    - Test failures (ImportError, AssertionError, etc.)
    - Linting failures (ESLint, PyLint)
    - Build failures
        ↓
Determines if auto-fixable:
    - Linting: YES (run linter --fix)
    - Simple test fixes: MAYBE
    - Complex failures: NO (human needed)
        ↓
Creates Slack notification with analysis and suggested actions
```

## PR Auto-Review (`pr-reviewer.py --watch`)

Automatically reviews new PRs from others when running in watch mode.

```
~/context-sync/github/prs/*.md (all synced PRs)
        ↓
pr-reviewer.py --watch (runs after github-sync)
        ↓
Scans for new PRs not yet reviewed
        ↓
Skips your own PRs (no self-review)
        ↓
For each new PR from others:
    - Analyzes diff content and patterns
    - Checks for security concerns
    - Reviews code quality
    - Identifies performance issues
        ↓
Creates review notification with findings
        ↓
Marks PR as reviewed (tracks in state file)
```

**State Tracking:**
- State file: `~/sharing/tracking/pr-reviewer-state.json`
- Tracks which PRs have been reviewed to avoid duplicates
- Persists across container restarts

**Usage:**
```bash
# Watch mode (scan and review new PRs)
python3 pr-reviewer.py --watch

# Review specific PR
python3 pr-reviewer.py 123

# Review specific PR in repo
python3 pr-reviewer.py 123 repo-name
```

## PR Code Review (On-Demand)

In addition to automatic failure monitoring, you can request on-demand code reviews for any PR:

```
User sends via Slack: "review PR 123" or "review PR 123 in webapp"
        ↓
Message appears in ~/sharing/incoming/
        ↓
Command Handler (runs every 5 min)
        ↓
Parses command: PR #123, repo: webapp
        ↓
PR Reviewer analyzes:
    - Diff content and file changes
    - Code quality patterns
    - Security concerns (eval, SQL injection, XSS)
    - Performance issues
    - Best practice violations
    - Testing coverage
        ↓
Creates Beads task: "Review PR #123: {title}"
        ↓
Generates comprehensive review:
    - Overall assessment
    - File-by-file analysis
    - Security/performance concerns
    - Testing gaps
    - Prioritized suggestions
        ↓
Sends Slack notification with full review
```

**Supported Commands:**
- `review PR 123` - Review PR #123 (auto-detects repository)
- `review PR 123 in webapp` - Review PR #123 in specific repo
- `/pr review 123` - Alternative syntax
- `/pr review 123 webapp` - Alternative with repo

**Review Coverage:**
- **Code Quality**: Console logs, TODOs, hardcoded values, code smells
- **Security**: eval/exec usage, SQL injection risks, XSS vulnerabilities
- **Python**: Bare exceptions, print statements, string formatting
- **JavaScript**: var keyword, == vs ===, dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- **Performance**: Potential performance bottlenecks
- **Testing**: Missing test coverage for new code

## Comment Response (Automatic)

Automatically detects new PR comments on **your PRs** and generates suggested responses:

**Scope**: Only processes:
- PRs you've opened (`--author @me`)
- Comments from others (skips your own comments and bots)
- Future expansion: PRs you're tagged on for review

```
Host syncs PR comments every 15 min
        ↓
~/context-sync/github/comments/
    repo-PR-123-comments.json
        ↓
Comment Responder (runs every 5 min)
        ↓
Detects new comment (not previously seen)
        ↓
Analyzes comment type:
    - Question (?, "why", "how", "what about")
    - Change request ("fix", "update", "change to")
    - Concern ("worried", "concern", "might")
    - Positive feedback ("LGTM", "looks good")
        ↓
Creates Beads task: "Respond to {author}'s comment on PR #{num}"
        ↓
Generates contextual response:
    - Based on comment type

## Monitored Check Types

- **pytest**, **jest**, **mocha** (test frameworks)
- **eslint**, **pylint**, **flake8** (linters)
- **typescript**, **mypy** (type checkers)
- **build**, **compile** (build systems)
- **coverage** (code coverage)

## State Management

Tracks which failures have been notified to avoid spam:

**State file**: `~/sharing/tracking/github-watcher-state.json`

```json
{
  "notified": {
    "org/repo-123:eslint,pytest": "2025-01-20T14:30:00Z",
    "org/repo-456:build": "2025-01-20T15:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Only notifies once per unique combination of (PR + failed check names).

## Integration with Beads

Every PR check failure creates a Beads task:

```bash
beads add "Fix PR #123 check failures: eslint, pytest" \
  --tags pr-123,ci-failure,webapp,urgent \
  --notes "PR #123 in org/webapp
Failed checks: eslint, pytest
URL: https://github.com/org/webapp/pull/123"
```

This enables:
- Tracking fixes across sessions
- Resuming work after interruptions
- Coordinating with other work

## Logs

**Location**: `~/sharing/tracking/github-watcher.log`

```bash
# View logs
tail -f ~/sharing/tracking/github-watcher.log

# Recent activity
tail -n 50 ~/sharing/tracking/github-watcher.log
```

## Control

```bash
# Start watcher
~/khan/james-in-a-box/jib-container/watchers/github-watcher/github-watcher-ctl start

# Stop watcher
~/khan/james-in-a-box/jib-container/watchers/github-watcher/github-watcher-ctl stop

# Check status
~/khan/james-in-a-box/jib-container/watchers/github-watcher/github-watcher-ctl status

# Restart
~/khan/james-in-a-box/jib-container/watchers/github-watcher/github-watcher-ctl restart
```

## Startup

GitHub Watcher scripts are triggered automatically by the host's `github-sync.service` via `jib --exec` after each sync (every 15 minutes).

**No background process** - Each script runs once, performs analysis, creates notifications, and exits.

## Configuration

No configuration needed - automatically discovers PRs from synced data.

**Sync interval**: Every 15 minutes (host-side github-sync.timer)
**Analysis trigger**: Immediately after sync completes

Detection timing:
- Check failures: Within 15 minutes of failure occurring
- New PRs to review: Within 15 minutes of PR creation
- New comments: Within 15 minutes of comment posting
